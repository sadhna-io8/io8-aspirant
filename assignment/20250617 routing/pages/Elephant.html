      before and who learn and imagine what the elephant is like by touching it.
      Each blind man feels a different part of the animal's body, but only one
      part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the animal based on
      their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are
      different from each other. In some versions, they come to suspect that the
      other person is dishonest and they come to blows. The moral of the parable
      is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their
      limited, subjective experience as they ignore other people's limited,
      subjective experiences which may be equally true.[1][2] The parable

      the story. The Tittha Sutta is dated to around c. 500 BCE, during the
      lifetime of the Buddha.[4] Other versions of the parable describes sighted
      men encountering a large statue on a dark night, or some other large
      object while blindfolded.

      In its various versions, it is a parable that has crossed between many

      Sufi and Baháʼí Faith lore. The tale later became well known in Europe,
      with 19th-century American poet John Godfrey Saxe creating his own version
      as a poem, with a final verse that explains that the elephant is a
      metaphor for God, and the various blind men represent religions that
      disagree on something no one has fully experienced.[6] The story has been
      published in many books for adults and children, and interpreted in a
      variety of ways.

      There was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother,
      but only a tiny black kitten to cherish. The plague had not been kind to
      him, yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow; and
      when one is very young, one can find great relief in the lively antics of
      a black kitten. So the boy whom the dark people called Menes smiled more
      often than he wept as he sat playing with his graceful kitten on the steps
      of an oddly painted wagon.

      The earliest versions of the parable of blind men and the elephant are
      found in Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts, as they discuss the limits of
      perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several
      Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows

    <p>
      A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had
      been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and
      form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch,
      of which we are capable". So, they sought it out, and when they found it
      they groped about it. The first person, whose hand landed on the trunk,
      said, "This being is like a thick snake". For another one whose hand
      reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person,
      whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a
      tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said the
      elephant, "is a wall". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope.
      The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth
      and like a spear.

      The parable of the blind men and an elephant is a story of a group of
      blind men who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and
      imagine what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a
      different part of the animal's body, but only one part, such as the side
      or the tusk. They then describe the animal based on their limited

      versions of the parable of blind men and the elephant are found in
      Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts, as they discuss the limits of perception
      and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian
      variations, but broadly goes as follows:[7][2] A group of blind men heard
      that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town,
      but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they
      said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". So,
      they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. The first
      person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said, "This being is like a thick
      snake". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind

      elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand
      upon its side said the elephant, "is a wall". Another who felt its tail,
      described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is
      that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.

      In some versions, the blind men then discover their disagreements, suspect
      the others to be not telling the truth and come to blows. The stories also
      differ primarily in how the elephant's body parts are described, how
      violent the conflict becomes and how (or if) the conflict among the men
      and their perspectives is resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some versions, they stop talking, start listening and collaborate to
      "see" the full elephant. In another, a sighted man enters the parable and
      describes the entire elephant from various perspectives, the blind men
      then learn that they were all partially correct and partially wrong. While
      one's subjective experience is true, it may not be the totality of truth

    <p>
      The parable has been used to illustrate a range of truths and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy">fallacies;</a>
      broadly, the parable implies that one's subjective experience can be true,
      but that such experience is inherently limited by its failure to account
      for other truths or a totality of truth. At various times the parable has
      provided insight into the relativism, opaqueness or inexpressible nature
      of truth, the behavior of experts in fields of contradicting theories, the
      need for deeper understanding, and respect for different perspectives on
      the same object of observation. In this respect, it provides an easily
      understood and practical example that illustrates ontologic reasoning.
