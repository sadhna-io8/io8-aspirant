      I have been a lucky dog right from the beginning. You see, I was born in a
      field and my mommy took such good care of me — I got all the milk and all
      the warmth I wanted. I loved nuzzling-in with my brothers and sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another piece of good luck was when I was just striking out on my own (I
      was seven weeks old), and Don, Mary, and their son, Tom were driving by.
      They stopped, saw that I had no collar, let alone a chip, and gently put
      me in the car, right on Tom’s lap. I knew this was going to be good. And
      yes, they turned out to be my forever family.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have such memories. I had heard through the bonevine that many dogs have
      to sleep in crates or even outside in a doghouse. But from Night One, I
      slept in Tom’s bed and he didn’t even make me sleep at the foot of the
      bed. He let me nuzzle right in, just like I did with my mommy.

    </p>
    <p>
      And we had a backyard, an enclosed backyard, so I could romp and do my
      business without my family worrying I’d run away. I must admit that if
      there were an opening, I’d be tempted to go out and explore, but it was
      fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got plenty chance to explore when Don, Mary, or Tom took me on a walk —
      Oh the sights and smells — other people, flowers, other doggies! And oh
      when we took a trip somewhere — all new sights and smells. Of course, my
      favorite was Carmel — There’s an off-leash beach. I loved going in the
      waves, well, up to my ankles. Further out would have been scary. And most
      restaurants in Carmel have a patio, so I didn’t have to wait in the car.
      One restaurant even has a doggie menu! I always ordered their Quarter
      Hounder.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got older, my joints started to hurt. The vet said I have
      arthritis. And over the years, it got worse. It has gotten so bad that it
      really hurts to walk. And now, most of the time, I can’t even make myself
      get up to pee.
    </p>
    <p>
      So my family took me to the vet. I’m writing to you while on the vet’s
      table. She just came in and gave me a shot. It’s making me sleepy and Don,
      Mary, and Tom are all crying, I don’t know why. I just know that I’m
      getting very sleepy, so I’ll say goodbye for now.
