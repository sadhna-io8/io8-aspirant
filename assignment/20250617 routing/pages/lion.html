      was summer, and the lion came out of his den on a hot afternoon. He was
      starving for food, and his stomach rumbled with hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king of the jungle had eaten nothing for the last two days. The lion’s
      mouth was dry with thirst. He started walking and went to the nearby river
      and drank some water. After drinking the water, he felt better. He then
      started searching for a portion of food, and after some time, he found a
      hare eating grass.

    <h1><i> The Lion Sitting Under a Tree on a Hot Summer Day</i></h1>
    <p>
      The lion was extremely happy that he had found the food to fulfil his
      hunger. He started thinking that the hare looked very delicious. Then the
      lion came silently behind the hare to hunt it down.

    <h2>
      <strong>Lion Landed on the Back of The Hare</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      After a while, the lion landed on the back of the hare. But the lion was
      disappointed after seeing the size of the hare. The lion thought this hare
      was too small to fill my stomach. After feeling extremely disappointed, he
      decided to kill the hare, and then suddenly he noticed a deer at some
      distance.

    <h3>The Lion Goes After The Deer to Catch Her</h3>
    <p>
      His greedy eyes widely opened, and his mouth started salivating. The lion
      had thought that despite eating the small and slim hare, he could eat that
      large deer that would relieve him of hunting for the next few days as he
      could save the meat of the deer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately, he let that hare go; the hare was extremely relieved and
      thanked God for this great escape. The lion then started to run to catch
      the big and looking delicious deer. After sensing the lion's presence, the
      deer began fleeing in seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      She( the deer) ran extremely fast through the jungle and vanished into the
      deep jungle. The lion was breathing hard and finally stopped in a huge
      cloud of dust. Now he had nothing to eat as the hare had also run away,
      and he could not find any animal in the vicinity. He became disappointed
      and cried out.
    </p>
