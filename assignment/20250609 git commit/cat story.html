      It is said that in Ulthar, which lies beyond the river Skai, no man may
      kill a cat; and this I can verily believe as I gaze upon him who sitteth
      purring before the fire. For the cat is cryptic, and close to strange
      things which men cannot see. He is the soul of antique Aegyptus, and
      bearer of tales from forgotten cities in Meroe and Ophir. He is the kin of
      the jungles lords, and heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister Africa.
      The Sphinx is his cousin, and he speaks her language; but he is more
      ancient than the Sphinx, and remembers that which she hath forgotten.</p1

     <br>In Ulthar, before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats, there
      dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats
      of their neighbors. Why they did this I know not; save that many hate the
      voice of the cat in the night, and take it ill that cats should run
      stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight.<br But whatever the reason,
      this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat
      which came near to their hovel; and from some of the sounds heard after
      dark, many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying was exceedingly
      peculiar. But the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man
      and his wife; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of
      the two, and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under
      spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard. In truth, much as the
      owners of cats hated these odd folk, they feared them more; and instead of
      berating them as brutal assassins, merely took care that no cherished pet
      or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees. When
      through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed, and sounds heard
      after dark, the loser would lament impotently; or console himself by
      thanking Fate that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished.
      For the people of Ulthar were simple, and knew not whence it is all cats
      first came.</p3>
